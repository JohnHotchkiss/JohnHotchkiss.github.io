<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. The majority of home centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close.
