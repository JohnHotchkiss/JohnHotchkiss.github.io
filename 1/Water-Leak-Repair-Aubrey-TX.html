<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
