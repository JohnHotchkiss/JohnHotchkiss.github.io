<p>Water softeners eliminate issues caused by tough water inside your home. Not all water is hard, but you understand if you have it. Dissolved minerals discovered in hard water can clog drains, build scale in pipes, and make your appliances less efficient. It also impacts the quality of your laundry and the lather of soaps in your showers. You can solve these problems by adding a water softener system to your house.</p>
<p>If you experience clogs and backups in your house more than a couple of times, it's a good concept to have a professional examine your drain system. A drain specialist like TLC will utilize a camera to inspect your drain system. Typically, if you have several drain problems you might have a drain line break someplace in your home or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can find and recognize the problem so the drain can be repaired.</p>
