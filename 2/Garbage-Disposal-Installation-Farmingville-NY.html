<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has actually often been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process.

But the truth is that water softening simply eliminates solidity minerals and removes problems that are a problem and not a threat to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not requirement. However, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this choice a significant one.</p>

This can force the drinkable water to reverse its instructions of flow through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Prospective contaminants can then get in the safe and clean water supply. The very best way to minimize build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially tough with high mineral material, you may need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>
