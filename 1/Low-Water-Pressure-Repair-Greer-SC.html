<p>If you have sensitive skin, eczema, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis or dry winter season itch it's a great concept to switch a precipitating water softener for a non-precipitating water softener.

The metal pipes are galvanized steel or brass, copper, and iron. The plastic pipes are Poly Vinyl Chloride PVC, Chlorine Poly Vinyl Chloride CPVC, Poly Ethylene PE, Polybutylene PB, and Kitec.

<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leaks take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
