<p>Backflow preventers are important for producing a safe water system system. No matter which design you select, all water softeners need to be correctly maintained. The brine solution should be mixed and saved in the salt water tank. Regular obstructing of the resin likewise requires special attention. For example, if the raw water supply is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. Often, typical backwashing with water will solve this problem. If not, gradually stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Likewise, fungis and germs also form mats in the resin that lower its effectiveness. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these problems. Nevertheless, read the manufacturer's instructions prior to adding any chemicals to the system.</p>
