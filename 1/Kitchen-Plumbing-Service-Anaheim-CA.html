<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc developed and developed a smaller model that ran on the very same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It can cleaning large industrial and municipal sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
<p>The system has returned to a zero need condition (no valves open downstream). Nevertheless, particles in between the # 1 Inspect Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the components, is preventing the # 1 Check from closing all the way. This allows pressure to equalize in between the Supply Side and the Zone of Minimized Pressure. When this takes place, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
