<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Santa Monica CA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Regrettably, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leakages happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these issues.</p>
<p>A brand-new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the within used thin pipe and the painting the inside of the used pipe with epoxy paint. Often during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin spots leak right away and sometimes those leaks come days or weeks later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up needing to be correctly re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
