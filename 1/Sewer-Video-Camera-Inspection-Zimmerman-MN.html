<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Zimmerman MN</h3>
<p>The most effective way to address difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions.
