<p>In many cases, the toilet can be repaired instead of changed, given that the concern frequently comes down to a single element or more. Sometimes, however, the damage is so substantial that you either need to replace the whole toilet, or the cost of repairs is so big that replacement is merely a more useful alternative. This normally includes fractures in the toilet bowl itself, widespread rust over numerous components, or just because you  wish to replace your existing toilet with something more visually pleasing.</p>
<p>For gas lines that need to be run under ground, an unique kind of black pipe must be used that is coated with a special plastic material that keeps the wetness out.
