<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Covington KY</h3>
<p>When pipes are set up into a vertical type it is described as a hydrostatic loop. In this configuration the loop need to be higher than 33 feet to work properly. When created by doing this it prevents siphoning and backflow into a water supply. Plumb Crazy Plumbing uses a standard 1 month service warranty on repairs, drain cleaning and 1 year guarantee on replacement plumbing tasks.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This triggers the disc to open, permitting air to go into the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
