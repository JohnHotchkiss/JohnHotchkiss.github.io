<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less critical things that can deteriorate or break.

Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
