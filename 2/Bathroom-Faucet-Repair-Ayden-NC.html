It permits significant energy savings and an unlimited supply of warm water. Adios cold showers! We install, repair and service all brands offered at rates our competitors can't touch.</p>
<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has typically been misunderstood as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mostly to overstated advertising and, in part, to customer misconceptions about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening just eliminates hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are an annoyance and not a danger to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers personal choice not requirement. However, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
