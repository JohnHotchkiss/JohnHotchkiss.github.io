<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Yorktown IN</h3>

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers carry just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
