<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
