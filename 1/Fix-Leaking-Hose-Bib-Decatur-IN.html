Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular occurrence, however it does occur more frequently than you believe! When you don't discover the water was off for a few minutes, frequently it happens at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>

<p>Lots of bad things are being said on this article about liners. I discover that numerous old time plumbers are not informed on liners and have no clue on what they are saying.
