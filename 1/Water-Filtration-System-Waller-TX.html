Contact us today if you're in need of a professional plumber or if you're preparing a plumbing remodeling job. It's prevalent for a toilet to have broken parts eventually which causes the toilet to run. When somebody says a toilet is running, what they mean is the toilet won't stop running. This is usually due to worn flapper valve, but a few other common problems are the fill valve and the overflow tube.</p>
<p>When the potable supply piping is linked to a system or component which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may take place. Greater pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not correctly safeguarded, non-potable and potable water or liquids can be pushed into the drinkable supply system.</p>
<p>A cross connection is a connection in between a drinkable drinking water supply and a possible source of contamination or pollution. Under the arrangements of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1971, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established nationwide standards for safe drinking water. Each state is required to implement the various policies of the Safe Drinking Water Act and how it relates to its state laws.</p>
