<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the needed instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. There is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health danger if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for efficiency, as well as checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
