<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had actually backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink.

<p>During typical operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of lowered pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is developed to release and open water to the outside if either check valve must leak.

For this factor, the RPZ must be installed in areas that are not subject to water damage and enable adequate drainage.</p>

At the least, it would have been a really costly option.</p>
