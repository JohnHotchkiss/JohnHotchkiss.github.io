<p>In community water system systems, water is usually preserved at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream to and out of the plumbing components in your house or service. When the pressure drops for some reason such as might occur when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to eliminate a water or a fire main breaks or some other situation takes place, polluted water might be drawn into the system. To prevent such an incident, there needs to be some kind of backflow prevention approach used. The very best and safest type of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the component). If an air gap is not possible, then the appropriate backflow prevention device is required. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water supplier.</p>
