<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical flow direction within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>While gas leaks are not as typical as other plumbing problems they still take place. Leaks triggered by rust, improper installation or by digging do happen, and when it does, you need a gas line repair expert to take care of the problem. As soon as a gas leak has been found, you will need a skilled plumber to come out and make repairs. You can depend on Parker & Sons Plumbing for any gas line repairs you need.</p>
