If all of your DIY efforts do not work, interruptions in the sink, bathtub, shower and toilets might be covered by an American House Shield plumbing warranty depending on the cause. When you come across a covered plumbing issue, no matter how huge or how small, contact AHS for help.</p>
<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the within the used pipe with epoxy paint. In some cases throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes. A few of those thin spots leak immediately and often those leakages come days or weeks later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be appropriately re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
