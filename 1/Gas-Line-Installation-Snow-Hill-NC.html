<p>Backflow preventers are vital for creating a safe water system system. No matter which model you choose, all water softeners need to be properly maintained. The salt water option must be blended and saved in the salt water tank. Periodic clogging of the resin also needs unique attention. For example, if the raw water supply is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, normal backwashing with water will fix this problem. If not, slowly stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help separate the product. Similarly, germs and fungi also form mats in the resin that lower its effectiveness. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these annoyances. Nevertheless, read the producer's instructions before including any chemicals to the system.</p>
