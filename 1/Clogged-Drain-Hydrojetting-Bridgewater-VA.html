<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, however how do they work and which styles are best for certain applications? Often the type and installation requirements are spelled out by ecological guidelines and local statutes. Local building codes for example will require a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air space in between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any prospective siphon before it can occur, preventing polluting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more sophisticated and complex backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices installed to prevent backflow variety from the reasonably simple to the really advanced and complex.</p>
