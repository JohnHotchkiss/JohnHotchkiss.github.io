<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system needs to be continuously kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
