<p>What is difficult water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains considerable amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather an annoyance-- for its many intended uses around your house.</p>
