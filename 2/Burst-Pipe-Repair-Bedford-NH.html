<p>Garbage disposals are a necessary feature in any modern kitchen. If you live in an older home, your sink might not have one, forcing you to be thorough about keeping food scraps from streaming down the drain. It's also possible for a disposal to unexpectedly break, bringing cooking or cleanup to a grinding stop. Copper pipes = $1.50-$ 2.00 per direct foot. Copper pipes are environmentally friendly and are resistant to breaking. Nevertheless, they're also the most pricey in this list and in areas with tough water (like Florida) they can develop pinhole leaks.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another factor to consider. While you can buy designs with unique features that do whatever but include the salt, you will pay for each extra function. The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm assurance that the unique function will not stop working. Depending upon the water source, you may have to filter turbid water or disinfect bacteria-laden water-all prior to it even reaches the softening system. Lastly, if you own a septic tank, you ought to consider the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regeneration. Estimates indicate that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regeneration cycle. This might or might not cause hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
