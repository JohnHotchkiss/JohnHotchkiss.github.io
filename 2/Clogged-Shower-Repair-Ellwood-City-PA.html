However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does happen more frequently than you believe! When you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, often it occurs at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building jobs quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants.
