<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping. Plumbing problems aren't just difficult to discover, they're also capable of causing some serious damage. Pinhole leakages, for example, are so little that they just launch a couple of beads at a time. That's far too small to cause a drop in water pressure, or any of the other signs that might warn of a leak in the system. A journeyman plumber and his assistant arrived throughout the appointed time period. They disconnected the sinks, cleaned up and recommended a tool to be utilized in the future.</p>
<p>Step, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may require extra adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
