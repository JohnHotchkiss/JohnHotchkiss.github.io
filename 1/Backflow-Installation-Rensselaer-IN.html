<p>Backflow preventers are crucial for developing a safe water system system. No matter which model you choose, all water softeners need to be effectively maintained. The salt water option should be mixed and stored in the salt water tank. Periodic obstructing of the resin likewise needs unique attention. For example, if the raw supply of water is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, normal backwashing with water will resolve this issue. If not, gradually stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help separate the material. Also, germs and fungi also form mats in the resin that reduce its efficiency. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these annoyances. However, check out the manufacturer's instructions before including any chemicals to the unit.</p>
