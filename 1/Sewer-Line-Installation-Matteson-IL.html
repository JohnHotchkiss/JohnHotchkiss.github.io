<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Matteson IL</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>The annoying dripping must be the least of your concerns when you have a leaking faucet.
