<p>If you need a water softener is a personal preference, identifying. A license is not needed for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions provided changes are not made in the existing piping or components. A typical water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a neighboring drain or drywell.</p>

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
