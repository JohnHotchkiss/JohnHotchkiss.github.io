<h3>Discover The World Of Faucets For Improved Water Conservation Bristol IN</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to resolve tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that go through fouling, wear or fatigue. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers need to be tested occasionally to ensure they are working properly. A visual check of air gaps suffices, but mechanical backflow preventers have to be tested with appropriately calibrated gauge devices.</p>
