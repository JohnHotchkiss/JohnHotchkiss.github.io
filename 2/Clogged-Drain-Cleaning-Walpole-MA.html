<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system should be constantly monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
