<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets ought to absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet must be changed. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural stability of the house.</p>
<p>Most softeners have a bypass developed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to offer some kind of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're working on installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to build one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to maintain the unit.</p>
<p>In many cases, when you have a clogged drain or toilet, an auger is utilized to unclog the pipe and get rid of the debris. Depending on the severity of the clog, or how far into your sewer pipe the clog lies, a high powered auger might be needed.
