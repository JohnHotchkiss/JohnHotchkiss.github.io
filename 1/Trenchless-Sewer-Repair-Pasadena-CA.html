<p>Both irrigation water and clean water supply are at high risk of entering into contact with toxins due to backflows. Numerous faucets can have a low-flow aerator installed at the outlet end of the water spout.

The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
