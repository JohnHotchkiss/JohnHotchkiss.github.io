There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, triggered the spread of sickness or disease.</p>
<p>In addition to the garbage disposal system, there are a variety of upgrades and parts that you might need to consider when weighing the garbage disposal installation cost. For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then unfavorable or lower pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
