<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. Much of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the appropriate safety measures.</p>
