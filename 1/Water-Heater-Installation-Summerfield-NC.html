<p>Noise is typical, but when you notice that the sounds are all there but food is not being ground up it is likely that the motor has gone. Some noises show the need for repairs or a good clear out, and you can provide the system a good check prior to starting to price new ones. However if your disposal is old enough, repairs will cost you money for extremely little future use.</p>
<p>There are two types of materials used to develop a waste disposal unit unit: aluminum and stainless-steel. The average cost of an aluminum waste disposal unit ranges from $60 to $150, while a stainless steel garbage disposal has an average cost of just over $150. Sewer pipes can be notoriously difficult to trace, especially on older residential or commercial properties, so you'll wish to employ someone who will trace the problem at its origin.</p>
<p>As pointed out, clogged or blocked drains and pipes can cause damage to your house. Not just can unclean pipes cause your water to drain slowly, however it can also trigger pipes to burst and sewage-disposal tank back-ups. Ensure you do not have a plumbing catastrophe and ensure your pipes are clean. 1. Remove the garbage disposer and detach all the old traps and drain lines from below the sink.</p>
