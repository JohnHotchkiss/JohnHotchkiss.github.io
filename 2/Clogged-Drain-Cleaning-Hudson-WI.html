An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes construction tasks easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical cause of backflow. Fire engine utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
