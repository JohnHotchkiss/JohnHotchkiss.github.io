<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
