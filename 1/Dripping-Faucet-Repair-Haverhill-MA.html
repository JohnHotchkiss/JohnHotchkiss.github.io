<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most terrible and prevalent water problems: difficult water.  Tough water wreaks havoc on the modern house. Scale develops in your pipes, blocking them and reducing water pressure.  Scale significantly shortens the lifespan of devices like dishwashers, coffee makers and ice makers. Difficult water ruins warm water devices. The greater the temperature of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will harden and strengthen into solid deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>

<h3>Fast Emergency Plumbers Near Me Haverhill MA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
