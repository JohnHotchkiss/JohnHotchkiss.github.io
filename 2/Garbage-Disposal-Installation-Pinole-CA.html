<p>Anti-Scale Devices: Some water heaters promote features that reduce mineral scale accumulation by churning water in the bottom of the tank. Functions such as these include cost, and aren't that reliable. Your best strategy is to get the water heater with the 12 year service warranty. Chlorinated Polyvinylchloride Piping (CPVC) piping materials cost from $0.40 to $1.56 per linear foot.
