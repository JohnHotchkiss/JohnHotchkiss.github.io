<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Burke VA</h3>
<p>Rust is a complex phenomenon and there are numerous factors that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that speed up deterioration Also, there is a lack of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of deterioration control.
