But utilizing PEX would cost just $4,000 to $6,000, according to Gove. That's since of lower material and labor costs. If it takes you two days to re-plumb a house with copper, you can do that very same house in a day with PEX," says Emanuel.</p>

In either case, scalding water is dangerous and need to be right away attended to by a skilled plumbing professional.</p>
