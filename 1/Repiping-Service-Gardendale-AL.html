<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health danger if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of illness or disease.</p>
