<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Latonia KY</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Regrettably, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leakages happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these issues.</p>
