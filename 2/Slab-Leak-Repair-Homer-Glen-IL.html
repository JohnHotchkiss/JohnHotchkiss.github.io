<h3>Fast Emergency Plumbers Near Me Homer Glen IL</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
