<p>We're changing a natural gas hot water heater in our presentation. The actions for replacing a gas hot water heater are precisely the same, and those for an electrical water heater are similar. Recurring leaks and repairs.

As an outcome, we advise replacing your system if it is over 10 years old.</p>
