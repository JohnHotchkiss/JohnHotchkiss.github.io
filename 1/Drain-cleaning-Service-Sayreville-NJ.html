Double check valve assembly (DCV) and minimized pressure zone assembly (RPZ) gadgets are most frequently used in commercial facilities.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as displayed in Picture 1. Water is most likely leaving through a cracked or worn away overflow tube if additional pressure on the flapper does not stop the running sound.
