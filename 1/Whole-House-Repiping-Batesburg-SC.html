Nevertheless, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, pool, water feature or other type of cross connection, have an approved backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
<p>Say you choose to go that path. The next concern is whether you can install it yourself. Put it by doing this, if you're a knowledgeable handy individual, but you've never handled this particular repair, you can most likely do it, supplying you do your research. I would draw the line at attempting to install a power-vented gas-fired hot water heater (and some other customized designs).
