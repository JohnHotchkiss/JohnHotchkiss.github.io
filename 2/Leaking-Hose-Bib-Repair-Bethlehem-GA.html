<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct impact on your safety, benefit, convenience, and reliability than your plumbing system. This is exceptionally essential! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to press the waste out of your drain system. Current policies limit the quantity of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles accumulating in cast iron drain lines.
