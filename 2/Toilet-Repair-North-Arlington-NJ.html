It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial areas in the assembly.

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are set up in areas where water might trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
