<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Mabank TX</h3>
<p>Leaking gas can cause asphyxiation and dangerous explosions. Fortunately, commercial gasses, such as the kind a gas stove or heater uses, have a strong odor contributed to them so that leakages can be more easily spotted by homeowners. If you smell a gas leak in your home, you need to act rapidly - contact Abacus Plumbing NOW at 713-766-3605 713 -766 -3605 Also, alert your gas company.</p>
<p>For gas lines that need to be run under ground, a special type of black pipe should be used that is covered with an unique plastic product that keeps the wetness out. This is so it is easily noticeable from underground water lines, and also due to the fact that the plastic finishing really protects the pipe much better than a galvanized coating would.</p>
