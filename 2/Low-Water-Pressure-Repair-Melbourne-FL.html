<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
