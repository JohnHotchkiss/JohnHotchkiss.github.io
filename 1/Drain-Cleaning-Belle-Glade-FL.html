<h3>Why Plumbers Should Install Water Heaters in Belle Glade FL?</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system needs to be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
