<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Windsor Locks CT</h3>

That toilet must be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural stability of the home.</p>
<p>The Battelle Study also discovered hard water to quickly lead to clogged shower heads, in many cases after as low as a year and a half of regular usage. After just one week of constant testing with tough water, more than three-fourths of shower head nozzles became clogged, according to laboratory results. Shower heads utilizing water treated by a water softening system, meanwhile, performed almost along with on the day they were installed.</p>
<p>The drains in the average house get continuous use. Hair, food scraps, soap scum, and other particles can slowly develop gradually. The drain will slowly slow until it becomes entirely clogged.

Using these chemicals frequently can trigger damage to your plumbing pipes.</p>
<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a considerable obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
