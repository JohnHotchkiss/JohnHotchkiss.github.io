<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
