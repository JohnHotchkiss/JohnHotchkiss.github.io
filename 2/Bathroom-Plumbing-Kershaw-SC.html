<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
