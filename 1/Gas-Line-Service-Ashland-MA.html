<p>It might be time to get it replaced if your water heater has actually required several repairs over the last few years. An excellent guideline for water heaters is this: since the life expectancy of the typical water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline prior to the problem worsened. Waiting simply wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive alternative.</p>
