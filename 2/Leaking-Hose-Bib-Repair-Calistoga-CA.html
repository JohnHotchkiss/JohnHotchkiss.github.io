<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the required instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. There is capacity for the polluted water to become a health threat if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for effectiveness, in addition to checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
