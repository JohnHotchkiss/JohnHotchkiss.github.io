<p>Waste disposal unit are an essential feature in any contemporary kitchen. If you reside in an older home, your sink may not have one, requiring you to be persistent about keeping food scraps from streaming down the drain. It's also possible for a disposal to all of a sudden break, bringing cooking or cleanup to a grinding stop. Copper pipes = $1.50-$ 2.00 per direct foot.

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the offender. However not constantly. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
