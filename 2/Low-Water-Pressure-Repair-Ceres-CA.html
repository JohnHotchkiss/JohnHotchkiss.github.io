<p>After showing up after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after among the 2 gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but declared they would not take responsibility if it leaked now because of some unspecified curiosity in how my sink was assembled. After they gave me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, since I never ever want to see this company once again.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and determine the reason for the issue. The line was plainly degrading; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
