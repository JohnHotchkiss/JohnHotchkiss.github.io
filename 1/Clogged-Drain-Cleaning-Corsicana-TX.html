<p>SofTap's water softening technology is well-suited for household, commercial, and industrial applications, consisting of the prevention of limescale build-up in homes and scaling in industrial water treatment systems, along with improving existing reverse osmosis treatment systems.

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers bring only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
