<p>Backsiphonage can take place when there is an unexpected decrease in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as during fire combating or when a water main breaks. At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This reversal can develop a suction result and draw possible pollutants into the safe and clean (drinking) water supply. Storage tank water heaters are typically discovered in the majority of houses. Their elements are an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water until it's required. A pipe emerges from the leading to provide warm water to its location, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>

Both will develop a good seal (though the gasket may lead to small amounts of water gathering around the flange), and what's used is mostly a matter of preference. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's harder to remove.</p>
