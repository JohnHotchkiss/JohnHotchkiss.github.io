This can be tricky, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is essential that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system needs to be utilized to ensure the line is correctly flushed.</p>
<p>Most plumbers will remove the old unit to install the brand-new one at the exact same hourly rate.
