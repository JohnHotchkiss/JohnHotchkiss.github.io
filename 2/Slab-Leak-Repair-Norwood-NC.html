<h3>Safe Alternatives In Fixing A Blocked Drain in Norwood NC</h3>
<p>For example, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will stream in reverse into the city water lines since pressure is lost throughout these events. Although an EcoWater dealer does not support your area presently, we are happy to assist you with an alternative solution. You can order, with complimentary shipping, a leading name-brand filtration or softener system by shopping at Any installation services listed below can then help with installation, or you can simply install the system yourself.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
