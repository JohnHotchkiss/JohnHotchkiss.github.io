<p>If these mixes aren't effective in unclogging your sink, grab a typical household plunger. If you have a double sink, first seal the second side with a damp cloth or a stopper. You'll need to create a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you plan to plunge with adequate water to cover the bell of the plunger. Location the plunger securely over the drain and plunge vigorously a number of times. When you hear the suction clear the clog, remove the plunger and flush the drain well with warm water.</p>
<p>When lime is contributed to the water, it alters the water chemistry, triggering the calcium to come out of the solution. The particles of calcium combine, become much heavier than the remainder of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins.
