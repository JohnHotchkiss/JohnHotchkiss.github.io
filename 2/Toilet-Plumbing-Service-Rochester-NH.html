<p>The typical life span of an electric water heater is more than that of a gas one. Unseen sets of pipes utilize pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a separate drain pathway, little pipes run from the tub and sink to eventually meet a bigger one beneath the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the house.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by continuously bringing tanks on-line and off-line in response to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style enables the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
