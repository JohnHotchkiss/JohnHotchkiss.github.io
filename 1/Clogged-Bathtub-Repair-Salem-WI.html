<p>Applications vary from softening in remote places to resolving issues of reagent addition. Motor sizes for garbage disposal are given in horse power, or HP. These correspond straight to just how much waste the unit can handle, and suggested sizes are typically based on the number of users remain in a household. If your existing disposal clogs frequently, is noisy, leakages or does not operate correctly, it might be time for a replacement. Installations need to just be carried out by plumbers as the installation requires both plumbing and electrical connections.</p>
