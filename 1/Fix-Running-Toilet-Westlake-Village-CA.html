Things to think about: Batch feed garbage disposals need a larger upfront cost. Some designs run more than double the cost of constant feed units. And considering that the drain stopper avoids you from feeding scraps continuously, batch feed gadgets may be inconvenient for households with a large quantity of food waste to grind.</p>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear.

<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most devastating and common water problems: hard water.  Tough water ruined the modern home.

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many house centers carry only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
