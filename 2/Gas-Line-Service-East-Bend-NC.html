<p>If you have read the paragraph above, you now understand that there different mechanical parts within your toilet's tank that enable your toilet to flush the water down the toilet bowl. When these parts become used or break they need to be replaced.

If you are one who falls under the latter classification, then your best choice is to provide Olin Plumbing a call, we understand how to fix any toilet and the appropriate parts to use.
