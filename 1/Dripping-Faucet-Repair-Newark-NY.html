For many years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that speed up deterioration Likewise, there is an absence of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective form of rust control. Thus, considering all these factors, along with results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
