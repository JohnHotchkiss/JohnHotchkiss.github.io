<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

<p>Reach for a typical household plunger if these combinations aren't successful in unclogging your sink. Very first seal off the 2nd side with a damp cloth or a stopper if you have a double sink. You'll need to create a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you intend to plunge with sufficient water to cover the bell of the plunger.
