<p>We had a terrific experience with Joe Boyette, he was extremely professional, polite, qualified. We had a great deal of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month period. We also needed to replace a bathroom and a water heater unassociated to the fire, but we felt confident in Joe's abilities. We made the decision to stick with Joe, even though we felt Mr Rooter rates were absolutely on the high end. This being published by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are set up in areas where water might trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
