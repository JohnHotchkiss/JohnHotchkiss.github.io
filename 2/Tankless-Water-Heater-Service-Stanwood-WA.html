<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and germs from becoming a problem in your water supply by sending out an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system.

The relief valve is created to discharge and open water to the outside if either check valve must leak.

For this reason, the RPZ should be set up in areas that are exempt to water damage and permit adequate drainage.</p>
