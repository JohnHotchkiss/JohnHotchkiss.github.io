<p>Sewer lines can fail for a variety of reasons, including bad soil conditions, blockages from grease and gunk, and rust. Even trees and bushes can trigger problems for sewer lines, particularly in older neighborhoods where clay pipe might have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be doubly intensified if pipes have been allowed to freeze.</p>
<p>A brand-new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of worn thin pipe and the painting the inside of the used pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes. A few of those thin areas leak right away and often those leakages come weeks or days later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up requiring to be appropriately re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
