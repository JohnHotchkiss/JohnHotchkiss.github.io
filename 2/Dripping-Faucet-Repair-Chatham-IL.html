<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can cause leakages. As these leakages happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these concerns.</p>
