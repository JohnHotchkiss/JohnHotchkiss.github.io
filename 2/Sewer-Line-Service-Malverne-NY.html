<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Malverne NY</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
