All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to potential contamination or poorer quality water, require a backflow prevention device.</p>
<p>Every water heater we install has actually been tested under the most extreme water temperature levels and was built to last a very long time.

Effectiveness and sturdiness are crucial components of every hot water heater we sell.
