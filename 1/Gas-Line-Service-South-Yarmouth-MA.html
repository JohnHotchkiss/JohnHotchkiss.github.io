<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and in other places during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and channels, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
