That's far too little to cause a drop in water pressure, or any of the other signs that may caution of a leak in the system.

If you are experiencing discolorations, attempt choosing a lower number till you find one that fulfills your requirements. Demand-initiated softeners are more efficient and popular than time-initiated softeners.</p>
