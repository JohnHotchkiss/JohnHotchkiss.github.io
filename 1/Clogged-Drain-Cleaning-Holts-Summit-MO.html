<p>The source or area of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another.

Easements (generally 10 feet broad) where main drains traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>

This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
