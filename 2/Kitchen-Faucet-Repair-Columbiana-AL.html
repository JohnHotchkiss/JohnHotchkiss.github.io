You can eliminate it safely with needle-nose pliers if you see an obstruction.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
