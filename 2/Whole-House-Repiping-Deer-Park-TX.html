When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. It can also cause the system to leak if the bypass valve is split. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or changed with time.
