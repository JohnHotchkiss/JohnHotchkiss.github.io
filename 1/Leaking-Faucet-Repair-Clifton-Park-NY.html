<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has area to hold on to positive ions. The fresh media begins by holding on to the weaker charged sodium ions. As difficult water goes through your water softener tank, the more powerful charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Given that the solidity minerals have a higher favorable charge than the salt, they will knock the sodium ions off and take their location.</p>
<p>When lime is added to the water, it alters the water chemistry, causing the calcium to come out of the solution. The particles of calcium combine, end up being much heavier than the remainder of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next action of the treatment procedure. Versatile gas lines are typically preferable to inflexible lines, particularly in areas where earthquakes are more typical and for the connection between the supply and device.
