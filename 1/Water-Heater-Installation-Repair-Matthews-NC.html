Depending on the length of time the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a nuisance-- for its lots of designated uses around your home.</p>

Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to remove.</p>
