To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
<p>Call 831-393-9321 for reliable and fast water heater solutions. Experience true quality service when you deal with our Seaside plumbers. Don't utilize harsh drain cleaning chemicals to attempt to unclog the unit if your disposal is clogged. Chemicals can damage the mechanical parts, shortening the life of the disposal.
