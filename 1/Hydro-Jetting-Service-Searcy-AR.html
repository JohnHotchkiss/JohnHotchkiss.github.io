However if your toilet is exhibiting any of the following indications, it might be time to replace it. When a water account is established, we evaluate backflow requirements for companies on a private basis. After removing standing water from the sink, put about 1/2 cup of salt down the drain before you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a few minutes, and then flush with hot water to clear the mixture.</p>
