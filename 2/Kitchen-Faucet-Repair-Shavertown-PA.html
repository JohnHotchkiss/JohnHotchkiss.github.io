<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and wish for the best is normal in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively working together that you can achieve this.</p>
