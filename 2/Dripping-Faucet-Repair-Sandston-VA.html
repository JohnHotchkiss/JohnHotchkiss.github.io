<p>Deterioration: The most typical problem is corrosion in the tank and pipes that connect to your water heater. This is especially true if you have unattended hard water, which consists of extreme minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the material over time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another element that is triggering the corrosion, you will eventually experience a leak in your hot water heater that is hard to repair. Leaks typically suggest a new unit replacement is in order.</p>
<p>If you see rust just in your warm water, then inspect the status of your hot water heater's anode rod. If you have actually never ever done this on your own, you might need a professional to do this. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is more than likely coming from the inside of your hot water heater. Replace your hot water heater as quickly as possible if this is the case. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your cold and hot water taps, you most likely have actually rusted piping.</p>
