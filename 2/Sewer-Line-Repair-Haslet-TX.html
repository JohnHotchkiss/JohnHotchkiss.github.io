<p>Most houses or structures that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition defense. As the external coating of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>I can't state enough good things about this company. Had a sewer repair required and had a really brief amount of time due to closing on a home sale. Every single person I experienced from Marquita doing logistics for my task to every member of the work crew. Friendly, communicated well, absolutely responsive and actually cared to help me through this extremely demanding task. All of individuals I experienced were good example for what a well run service organisation must be. Much thanks and gratitude. You're terrific.</p>
