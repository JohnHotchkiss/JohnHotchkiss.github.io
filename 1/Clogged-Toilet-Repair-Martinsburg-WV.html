<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Martinsburg WV</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
