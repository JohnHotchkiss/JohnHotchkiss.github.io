This makes building and construction projects quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical reason for backflow. Fire engine use huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
