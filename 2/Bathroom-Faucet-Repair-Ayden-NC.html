<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has typically been misunderstood as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mostly to overstated advertising and, in part, to customer misconceptions about water treatment.

The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers personal choice not requirement. However, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
