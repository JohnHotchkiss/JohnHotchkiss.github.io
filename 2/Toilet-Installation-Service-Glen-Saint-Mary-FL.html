<p>At the top of the old disposer, put a screwdriver or the wrenchette" into the right side of among the lugs in the mounting ring. While holding the bottom of the disposal with the other hand, rotate the mounting ring counterclockwise to launch the disposal. Understand that the disposal might consist of water and food waste, so bring it outside right-side up.</p>
<p>Your disposer may feature a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, instead of the standard plumber's putty as laid out below.

Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's harder to remove.</p>
