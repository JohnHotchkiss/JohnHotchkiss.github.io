<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor East Amherst NY</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
