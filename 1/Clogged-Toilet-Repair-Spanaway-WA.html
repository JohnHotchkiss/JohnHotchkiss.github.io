<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
