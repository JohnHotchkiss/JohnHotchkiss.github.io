<p>The Bureau of Plumbing and Gasfitting Inspections is a department of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections and is responsible for inspecting work performed by licensed plumbers and gasfitters to guarantee conformity with the plumbing and gas code. Bill 41-15 (PDF): The Existing Plumbing and Gasfitting Code of Baltimore County was approved by the County Council on May 4, 2015 with an efficient date of July 1, 2015.

<p>Energy Efficiency. Selecting a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star rating is a good idea. The energy efficiency of a storage hot water heater is indicated by its Energy Aspect (EF). The more effective the hot water heater the greater the EF ranking. Nevertheless, just because a water heater has a greater EF value, it doesn't always indicate it will have lower operating expense. You also need to think about the fuel source.</p>
