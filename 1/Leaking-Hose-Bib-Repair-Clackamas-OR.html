Since backflow preventer gadgets are made up of moving parts, seals, and springs and are subject to destructive substances, wear, and fatigue, it's vital to appropriately keep them to guarantee they correctly run and play their part in keeping our city's drinking water safe.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Most house centers bring only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall.
