<h3>Tips For Finding A Cheap Plumber Somers NY</h3>

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
