<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
