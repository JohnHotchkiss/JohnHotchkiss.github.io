<p>Rust is an intricate phenomenon and there are many elements that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that speed up rust Also, there is a lack of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of corrosion control. Therefore, thinking about all these factors, as well as arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that a properly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
