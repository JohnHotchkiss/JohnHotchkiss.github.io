<p>Both irrigation water and clean water systems are at high risk of entering into contact with toxins due to backflows. Lots of faucets can have a low-flow aerator set up at the outlet end of the water spout.

Adding air in this method maintains constant water pressure, which triggers the fixture to use less water.</p>
