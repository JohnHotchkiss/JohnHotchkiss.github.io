<p>To identify which toilet valve is causing the difficulty, take a look at the overflow tube. There's an issue with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, consistent outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing completely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water discolorations and corrosion. But don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
