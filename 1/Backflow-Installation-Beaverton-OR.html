<p>Most houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather security. As the external covering of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
