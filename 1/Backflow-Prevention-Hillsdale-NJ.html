<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some disposer units do not come with a power cable attached. If this is the case, eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1). Be sure to buy a circuitry set with the appropriate power ranking and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). Make sure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cable when you link the electrical wiring harness to the disposer.</p>

<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
