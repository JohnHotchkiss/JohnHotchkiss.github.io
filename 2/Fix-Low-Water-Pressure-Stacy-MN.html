<p>EcoWater's elite water softener system is our conditioner, readily available in a single-tank "cabinet" design. It is highly advised for either community or well water products. No one wants to stroll into a kitchen or a bathroom and discover a sink filled with black gunk. We need our faucets and sinks to be functioning correctly in order to support safe and hygienic living conditions too.</p>
<p>Leakages can occur if the seal in between the tank and bowl stops working, or the seal at the floor drain stops working.
