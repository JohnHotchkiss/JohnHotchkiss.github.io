Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
