<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, however how do they work and which designs are best for particular applications? Typically the type and installation requirements are spelled out by ecological guidelines and local statutes. Local building codes for instance will require a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air space in between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any prospective siphon before it can take place, preventing contaminating water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more complicated and sophisticated backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical devices installed to prevent backflow range from the relatively easy to the extremely advanced and complex.</p>

<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts need to be gotten rid of and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. It is necessary that just original factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the manufacturer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was designed to use and altering the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers should just be repaired when the information gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has actually degraded in its efficiency below the developed minimum standard. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if necessary, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This suggests the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
