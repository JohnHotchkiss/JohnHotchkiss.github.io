When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water.

The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, as well as checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
