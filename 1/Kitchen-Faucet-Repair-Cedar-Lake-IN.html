<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your house. Then that typically suggests that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience clogs in multiple drains at once in your home. This can occur in multiple locations and any combination of drains. For instance, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all link, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>
<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
