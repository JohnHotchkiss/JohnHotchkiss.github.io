<h3>Slab Leak Repair in Carpentersville Illinois</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did a minimum of 3 attempts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his understanding and experience he figured out that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the recently cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and patience the task was done to my complete fulfillment.</p>
<p>Converting from electric to natural gas or gas, or including appliances will always require brand-new pipes.
