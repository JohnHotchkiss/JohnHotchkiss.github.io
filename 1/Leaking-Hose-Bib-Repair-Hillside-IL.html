Prior to entering into how to repair a toilet, it would benefit to comprehend how a toilet works.  The majority of homes in the US, including Tampa Bay Area, have what is referred to as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets also have a flapper seal made of rubber at the bottom of the tank that keeps the water in the tank up until the toilet is flushed.  This seal degrades gradually permitting water to leave into the toilet bowl, thus decreasing the amount of water in the tank offered for a flush.  It also has the disadvantage of increasing your water costs due to wastage of water.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
