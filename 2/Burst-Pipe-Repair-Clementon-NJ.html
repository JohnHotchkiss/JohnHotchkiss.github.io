<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

However if your toilet is exhibiting any of the following indications, it may be time to replace it.

After removing standing water from the sink, put about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain prior to you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a few minutes, and after that flush with warm water to clear the mix.</p>
