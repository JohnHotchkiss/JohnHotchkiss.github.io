Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. A number of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the suitable preventative measures.</p>

If you smell rotten eggs, it is necessary to take action quickly to avoid any severe problems and to keep everybody safe.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and determine the cause of the issue. The line was plainly deteriorating; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
