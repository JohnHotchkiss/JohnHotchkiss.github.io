When chemicals are included to a fire security system supplied by a potable water supply, increased protection is likewise needed. If you have children, advise them to prevent holding on any visible pipelines or having fun with the outdoor gas meter. Holding on a pipeline may cause it to come loose or break, launching gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter should be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly available in an emergency.</p>
