<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps catch moisture and sediment so that they do not go into the control unit. Unlike a drip leg, the flow of the gas is altered to remove any sediment. A sediment trap may be included in a drip leg install. The City requires backflow prevention gadgets to be installed anywhere there exists a connection that could permit tainted water into the City system or private plumbing. These gadgets go through testing by a qualified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In most cases, they undergo periodic tests later on, too.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, take preventive action by allowing our gas plumbers to perform annual gas inspections and other needed gas line installation, replacement, and repair tasks.

<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest dual flush HET used by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.
