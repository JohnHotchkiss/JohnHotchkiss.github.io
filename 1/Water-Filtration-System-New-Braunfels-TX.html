<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and in other places throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure.
