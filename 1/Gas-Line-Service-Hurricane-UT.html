<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
