<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system needs to be continuously kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>

<p>After getting here after their window, they started to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but declared they wouldn't take duty if it dripped now due to the fact that of some undefined curiosity in how my sink was assembled. After they offered me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, given that I never want to see this company again.</p>
