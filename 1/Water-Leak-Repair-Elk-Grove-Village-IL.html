For many years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that accelerate rust Also, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient kind of rust control.
