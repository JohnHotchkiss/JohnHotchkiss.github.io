<p>The toilet takes an actually very long time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout normal operation, the pressure between the two check valves-- described as the zone of minimized pressure-- is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is designed to open and release water to the outside, ensuring backflow never takes place.</p>
<p>Backpressure might occur when the potable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. Drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be required into the potable supply system if these connections are not properly protected.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be checked by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report should be provided to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste better. The minerals in tough water can trigger a bad smell and taste. When you add a water softener, it eliminates the mineral material to produce odorless drinking water that tastes good.</p>
