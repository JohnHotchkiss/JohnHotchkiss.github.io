<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Morristown NJ</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>The irrigation backflow testing season is from May to September. Irrigation backflow prevention assemblies must be tested by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to make sure proper backflow prevention is in location to protect our drinking water throughout the irrigation season. Denver Water will send a testing reminder notification one month before the yearly test is due.</p>
