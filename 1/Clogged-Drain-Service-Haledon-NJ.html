<p>We had roots through our sewer line so it was often blocking. They came out and dug a new path for the line linked it to the sewer and whatever.

<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the potable system offering the cosmetics water, backpressure is developed. This can require the drinkable water to reverse its instructions of circulation through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Possible contaminants can then enter the drinkable water supply. The very best method to reduce build-up is have a professional flush it at least once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral material, you might need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>
