<p>When the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly.

<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that manages water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that ranges from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't set up appropriately, you may experience a frequently or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in wasted water.</p>
