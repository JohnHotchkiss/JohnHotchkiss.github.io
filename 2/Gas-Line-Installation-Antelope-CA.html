If not, gradually stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to assist separate the material. Likewise, bacteria and fungi also form mats in the resin that minimize its effectiveness.

<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that eliminates hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most terrible and prevalent water problems: difficult water.  Hard water wreaks havoc on the modern house. Scale develops in your pipes, obstructing them and reducing water pressure.  Scale drastically reduces the life expectancy of home appliances like dishwashers, coffee makers and ice makers.
