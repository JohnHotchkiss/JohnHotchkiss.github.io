That is why we offer a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) change the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) perform a color test.</p>

Since soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue, the reason you can feel the distinction on your skin is. This results in the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term firmness" came from ... it's difficult to clean in.</p>
