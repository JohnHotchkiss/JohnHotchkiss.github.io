<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Buchanan MI?</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system should be continuously monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
