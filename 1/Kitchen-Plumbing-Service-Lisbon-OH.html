<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some disposer units do not come with a power cable connected. If this is the case, remove the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1). Make certain to buy a wiring set with the proper power ranking and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). When you link the wiring harness to the disposer, ensure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cord.</p>
