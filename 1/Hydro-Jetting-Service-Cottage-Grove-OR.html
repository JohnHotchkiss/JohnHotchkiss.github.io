<p>When the components are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will accumulate.</p>

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system should be continually kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
