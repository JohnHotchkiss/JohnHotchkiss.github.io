<p>Surprise water leaks are typically difficult and have Potentially Major Consequences. Changing your flapper may need a little various steps than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To discover an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, but chances are you'll locate one of the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>

<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continuously bringing tanks on-line and off-line in action to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
