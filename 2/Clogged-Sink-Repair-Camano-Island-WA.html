For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that accelerate rust Likewise, there is an absence of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient type of deterioration control. Therefore, thinking about all these factors, along with results from research studies, WQA's position is that a correctly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
<p>Remove scratchy rashes and experience smoother, softer skin and hair with a point-of-use shower head water softener. These models connect to or replace your existing shower head to balance the pH of your water, stop scale from forming, and filter out minerals.
