Follow the directions that come with the systems. Backflow preventers must be examined annual for appropriate operation. In locations where it freezes, the backflow preventer should be protected from freezing. See the Watering System Winterization tutorial for details.</p>

Leaking sewer lines inside your house can harm floors, carpentry, and other valuable items such as cabinets.
