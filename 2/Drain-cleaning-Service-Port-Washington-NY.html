<p>However, you likewise need to think about the age of your system. If your system is getting near 10 years old, it's generally not a good idea to spend for repairs if they are worth more than half of the rate of a new system.

Depending upon the water source, you may have to filter turbid water or sanitize bacteria-laden water-all prior to it even reaches the softening system. Lastly, if you own a septic system, you must think about the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regeneration. Estimates suggest that about 50 gallons of water are utilized for each regeneration cycle. This might or might not cause hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>
