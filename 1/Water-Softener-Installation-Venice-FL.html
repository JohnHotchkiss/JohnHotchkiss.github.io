<p>The drains in the average house get continuous use. Hair, food scraps, soap residue, and other particles can slowly develop with time.

The pipe was in good enough shape to reline before the issue worsened. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive choice.</p>
