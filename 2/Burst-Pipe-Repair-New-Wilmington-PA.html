<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is typical in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
