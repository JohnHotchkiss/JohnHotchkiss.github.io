<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, however if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can present problems.</p>
