<p>Aside from these 2 essential parts, there are a myriad of little, possibly less critical things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>

Call your insurance coverage representative and verify your protection. When you have reviewed your policy and verified what is covered and what is not covered, double check with your agent to confirm that your understanding is correct.</p>
