<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften difficult water. Through a process called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>

Cleaners need to be used according to maker directions to prevent contamination.</p>
