<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
