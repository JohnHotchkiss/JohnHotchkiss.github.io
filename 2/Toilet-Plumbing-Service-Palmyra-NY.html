<h3>Resolution And Prevention Of Burst Pipes Palmyra NY</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leaks occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
