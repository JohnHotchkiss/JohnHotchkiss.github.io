<p>Many plumbers will remove the old system to install the brand-new one at the exact same hourly rate. This can increase the amount of time needed to install the brand-new unit, therefore increasing costs.

In many cases, elimination will just add an additional $25 to $50 to the overall expenses, but in many cases the costs might be greater if extra pipes need to also be changed.</p>
