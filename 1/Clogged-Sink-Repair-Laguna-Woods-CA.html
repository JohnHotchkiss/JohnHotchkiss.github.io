<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
