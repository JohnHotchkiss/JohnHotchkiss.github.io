Worms for irrigation systems: Residents found parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the air pressure breaker malfunctioned on a privately owned underground lawn sprinkler. During a water pressure drop, the vacuum in the system drew some water from the sprinkler into the city water. The house owner discovered worms swimming in the bathtub while filling it to bathe his child.</p>

The plumbing in your house must work well or backup can occur, and septic systems may need to be updated to deal with the disposal.
