That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Homeowners often bypass maintenance and take care of their garbage disposal. When we need it, we simply anticipate this workhorse situated under the sink to function as meant. That's not the case, though. Like any excellent plumbing system, the waste disposal unit needs attention-- ideally, professional care.
