<p>In many cases, our service technicians will suggest that you replace your water heater rather than purchase repairs. This is generally the case when the hot water heater is more than ten years old or the cost of repairs would total majority the cost of an entire brand-new unit. Often a problematic toilet simply requires a minor change and life is back to regular. That is why we provide a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) change the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) carry out a dye test.</p>
<p>In addition to work on standard hot water heater, we perform both installations and repairs of tankless water heaters.

A leaking toilet is another typical problem property owners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than likely means your toilet has a leak. This problem is frequently caused by a rusty pipe, flush valve assembly or as basic as a worn flapper valve.</p>
<p>You'll wish to keep a look for leaks too, of course. Even small ones that are quickly repaired might be indicators that the time for whole-house replacement is approaching. After all, the original pipes in your house are the very same vintage, they're made of the same product, and they have actually undergone the same supply of water and use patterns.</p>
