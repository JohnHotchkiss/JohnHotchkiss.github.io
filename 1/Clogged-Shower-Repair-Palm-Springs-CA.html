In time, dirt, debris, hair, and numerous other little particles can get trapped and build up in your pipes. Eventually, the water might not be able to drain quickly or effectively, and you might experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is constantly backing up.

<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend far more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
