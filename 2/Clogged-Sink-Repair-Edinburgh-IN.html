<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly.

More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been advised by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
