<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a substantial blockage that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
