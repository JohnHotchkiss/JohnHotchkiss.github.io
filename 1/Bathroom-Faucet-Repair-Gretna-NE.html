<p>A brand-new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the inside of the used pipe with epoxy paint. Often throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin areas leak right away and in some cases those leakages come days or weeks later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up needing to be effectively re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
