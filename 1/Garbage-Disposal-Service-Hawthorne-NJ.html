<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Hawthorne NJ</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular event, but it does happen regularly than you think! When you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, frequently it happens at night. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a new pipe. This makes building projects quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another common reason for backflow. Fire engine utilize substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants.
