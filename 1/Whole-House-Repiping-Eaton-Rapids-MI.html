<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet.
