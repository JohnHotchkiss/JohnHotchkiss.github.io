This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be gotten rid of from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from vital areas in the assembly.
