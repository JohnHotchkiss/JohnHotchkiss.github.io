<p>We're changing a natural gas hot water heater in our presentation. The steps for changing a gas water heater are exactly the same, and those for an electric water heater are comparable. Recurring repairs and leakages. If your hot water heater is over ten years old, it has actually likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. As an outcome, we advise replacing your unit if it is over ten years old.</p>
