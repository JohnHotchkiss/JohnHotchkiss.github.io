<p>The majority of toilets utilized today run with a basic gravity flushing style, indicating they utilize the force of the gravity to press the clean water into the bowl and after that on into the sewer system. Just recently, however, toilets using a vacuum flushing system have been appearing in increasingly more houses. This system uses a vacuum-assisted flushing mechanism to suck the water into the bowl and down into the drains. A downside of this device is that it's a lot more challenging to unblock your toilet were to become clogged.</p>
