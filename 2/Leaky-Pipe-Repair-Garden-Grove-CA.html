<p>New houses built with copper pipes are particularly prone to corrosive water conditions because the copper pipes have actually not had a chance to become covered within. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a period of 3 to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium.
