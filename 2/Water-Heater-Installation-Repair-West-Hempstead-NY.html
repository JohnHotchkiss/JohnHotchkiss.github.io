<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were really responsive and timely to send me a quote which was really competitive. They were really professional and did an amazing job.

This is obviously still an issue that requires to be dealt with right now (you'll likely need a brand-new water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
