<p>Woodbury, together with many other communities and companies, has actually found the very best way to avoid these stains from occurring is by minimizing the number of times your water softener restores.

Nevertheless, numerous water softeners regenerate too often, when the filter medium actually isn't complete. This can be corrected by just resetting your water softener to get rid of less hardness or to run longer between regrowth cycles.</p>
