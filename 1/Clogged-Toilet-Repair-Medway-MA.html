<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal flow instructions within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of regular flow in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

For example, if your pipe is experiencing a small leak however is in otherwise great condition, we would advise repairing it. Nevertheless, if the pipe is continuously leaking and requires regular repairs, we would advise repiping.

Recently, however, toilets utilizing a vacuum flushing system have actually been appearing in increasingly more homes.

A disadvantage of this device is that it's much more hard to unclog your toilet were to become clogged.</p>
