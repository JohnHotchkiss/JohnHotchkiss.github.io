<h3>Backflow Prevention Device Testing & Repair in Jerseyville Illinois</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
