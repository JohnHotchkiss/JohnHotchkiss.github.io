Salt ions are held loosely and are changed easily by calcium and magnesium ions. During this procedure, totally free" salt ions are launched into the water.

<p>Backflow preventers must just be fixed when the information gathered from the field test shows the assembly has deteriorated in its efficiency below the developed minimum basic. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to meet this minimum basic, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if essential, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to weaken in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This implies the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
