<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that controls water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't installed appropriately, you may experience an often or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in wasted water.</p>

<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service DFW Plumbing Service Bastrop LA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can cause leakages. As these leakages take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these problems.</p>
<p>There are several indications to keep an eye out for. 1) The surface area of the floor in one area is warm and even hot to the touch. 2) The dial on your water meter keeps spinning, even when all appliances and components in your house have been shut off. 3) The water heater appears to be running all the time. 4) All this adds up to greater gas and water costs, in some cases really rapidly.</p>

He said our bills should be lower now too.</p>
