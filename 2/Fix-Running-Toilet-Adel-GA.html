<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Double flush toilets: When it pertains to toilets, one flush does not fit all circumstances. New double flush toilets enable a one-gallon flush for liquid waste and a 1.5-gallon flush for strong waste all in the exact same handle. When simply the correct amount of water is used to flush, families can conserve significantly on their water bill over the course of a year.</p>
