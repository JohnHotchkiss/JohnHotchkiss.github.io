<p>These issues can be looked after other than for cracks in the body or interior lining of the disposal. If this is your problem, you will need to install a new garbage disposal.

Corrosion can still occur under conditions that are favorable to the formation of hard-water scale or perhaps when hard-water scale is already present.</p>
