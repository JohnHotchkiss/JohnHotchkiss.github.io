This is particularly true if you have untreated tough water, which contains harsh minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the material over time.

Owners and boards of structures that are issued an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer should file strategies with the DEP within 30 days. If the DEP has not received accreditation from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being installed within that time, a Notice of Infraction will be sent. Violators will be accountable for a civil charge of up to $1,000 provided by the Environmental Control Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can eventually result in civil and criminal actions and procedures, as well as the termination of water service to the structure.</p>
