To get your waste disposal unit working again, you will initially wish to use a flashlight to look for foreign things lodged in the drum's openings. You can eliminate it safely with needle-nose pliers if you see an obstruction.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>

Finally, if you own a septic tank, you must consider the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regeneration. Estimates show that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regrowth cycle. This might or might not cause hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>
