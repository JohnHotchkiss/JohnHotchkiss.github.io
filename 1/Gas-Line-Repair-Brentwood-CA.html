<p>Zurn Industries: In addition to providing an extensive line of backflow preventers, most of Zurn Wilkins' plumbing fixtures satisfy and go beyond the requirements developed by the Safe Drinking Water Act and lead-free initiative. Current changes to the Safe Drinking Water Act mandated that all commercial plumbing fixtures, valves, pipes, and fittings that are straight intended for human water intake are required to be made with less than 0.25 percent leaded brass material. Zurn Wilkins plumbing products that fall within this classification have actually been designated lead-free," meaning they are certified.</p>
<p>Other pipe repair techniques include our Pipe Pull method and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull technique interchanges harmed sewer or water lines with new piping by the use of a tiny hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into location. All brand-new replacement pipes have a projected lifespan of one a century and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another reliable technique is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically gets rid of the need for broken pipe elimination. By inserting a hardening lining material which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a new pipe is created inside the broken one.</p>
