Nevertheless, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining might conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
