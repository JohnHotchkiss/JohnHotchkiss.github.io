<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals feature home appliance wires connected, and others do not. Get rid of the cover plate underneath the disposal and connect the wires according the producer's guidelines if yours doesn't. Many standard disposals have you connect white wires to white wires and black wires to black wires. Screw the cover plate back on when you're completed.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be triggered due to buildup and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the issue if this is the case.

I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole.
