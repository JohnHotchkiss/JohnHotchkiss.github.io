Dissolved minerals discovered in hard water can clog drains, build scale in pipes, and make your appliances less efficient.

Typically, if you have several drain problems you might have a drain line break someplace in your home or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can find and recognize the problem so the drain can be repaired.</p>
