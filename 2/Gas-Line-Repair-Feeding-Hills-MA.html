<p>Concealed water leaks are frequently difficult and have Potentially Serious Repercussions. Replacing your flapper might require somewhat various steps than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task. To find an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before getting rid of the flapper.)

If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
