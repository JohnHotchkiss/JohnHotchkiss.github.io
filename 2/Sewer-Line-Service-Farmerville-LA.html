<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first shot using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A lot of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs.
