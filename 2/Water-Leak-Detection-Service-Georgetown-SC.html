<p>You have actually most likely seen drain cleaner products on the racks at your local home enhancement store, so when your drain gets clogged or isn't draining water like it should, you may be tempted to head down there and choose some up to fix it by yourself. These products, after all, make the procedure appear pretty basic. Sadly it's not as easy as you might think, and those products are not always going to fix the issue. In most cases it's more advantageous to employ a professional plumber in Utah.</p>
<p>Contact Mercy Plumbing at (832) 734-9731 We can help figure out the most economical option if you think it's time to consider repiping your house.

<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this method, you understand the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
