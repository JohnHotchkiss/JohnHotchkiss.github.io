<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, however how do they work and which styles are best for particular applications? Typically the type and installation requirements are spelled out by local statutes and ecological regulations. Local building regulations for instance will need a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air gap between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any possible siphon prior to it can happen, preventing contaminating water from being drawn back into the pipe system.

<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
