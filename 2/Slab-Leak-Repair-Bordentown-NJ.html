<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Bordentown NJ</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can lead to leakages. As these leaks occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these concerns.</p>
