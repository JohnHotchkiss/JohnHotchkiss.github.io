The garbage disposal is among the most misused home appliances in the whole house. Few house owners understand that a disposal is designed particularly to handle food residue rinsed from a plate-- not whole portions of leftovers! Large quantities of food can quickly overwhelm the system and trigger a comprehensive clog. That's why Pratt Plumbing receives numerous call requesting garbage disposal repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>Know that softened water includes trace amounts of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water includes about the same amount of salt as a piece of bread. That's not very much salt, but for those on a rigorous sodium-free diet it might be excessive. If this doesn't work, you might need to replace among your toilet's elements, typically the flapper. There might also be a problem with the chain connected to the flapper or the float ball. A plumber can easily replace these parts.</p>
