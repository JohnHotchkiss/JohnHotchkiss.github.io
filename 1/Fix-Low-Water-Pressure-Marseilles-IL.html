<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
