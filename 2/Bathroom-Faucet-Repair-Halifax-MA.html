<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of significant surgery, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes.

We find that repiping can in fact be the more affordable and better long-lasting solution if you do have frequent leakages.</p>

We'll work to repair the problem and examine as efficiently and efficiently as possible, getting your hot water heater up and running in no time.

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the offender. However not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can cause trouble too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
