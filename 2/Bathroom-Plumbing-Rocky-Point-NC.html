<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. There is potential for the infected water to become a health hazard if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for efficiency, as well as examined yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
