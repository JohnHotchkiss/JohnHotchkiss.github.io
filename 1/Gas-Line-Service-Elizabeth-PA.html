<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
