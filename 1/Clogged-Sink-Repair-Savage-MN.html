<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a considerable obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
