<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the needed direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is capacity for the infected water to end up being a health danger if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, as well as checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
