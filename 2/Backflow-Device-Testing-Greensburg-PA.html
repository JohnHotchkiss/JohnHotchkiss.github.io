<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the reason for the issue.

Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
