Atmos Energy does not preserve the natural gas lines on your property beyond our meter, this is the exact same as other utilities, such as your electrical wiring and pipes. When water enters your house from the main supply of water line, it needs to only ever stream in one direction: into your house.</p>
<p>There are a number of signs to look out for. 1) The surface area of the floor in one area is warm or perhaps hot to the touch. 2) The dial on your water meter keeps spinning, even when all home appliances and components in your house have been shut off. 3) The water heater appears to be running all the time. 4) All this amounts to higher gas and water expenses, often extremely rapidly.</p>
