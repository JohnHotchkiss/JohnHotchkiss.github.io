<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
