These gadgets are not created as a whole-system backflow prevention valve; one need to be set up at every control valve. Sprinkler Warehouse does not suggest AVB's for waterings systems where there is a prospective to pollute drinking water. AVB's are not testable and it is not possible to spot when one has failed.</p>
