<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct result on your security, benefit, comfort, and dependability than your plumbing system. This is incredibly essential! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to press the waste out of your drain system. Current policies limit the quantity of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris accumulating in cast iron drain lines.
