The issue could spread out greatly if that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in specific homes, it also prevents wastewater in personal homes from flowing back out and polluting the general public water system.</p>

That's not very much salt, however for those on a strict sodium-free diet it may be too much. If this doesn't work, you may need to replace one of your toilet's components, usually the flapper. There may likewise be an issue with the chain connected to the float or the flapper ball. A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>
