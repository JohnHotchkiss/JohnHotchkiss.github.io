It's particularly important to make certain your water softener lies prior to your water heater, as difficult water does the best damage to warm water home appliances.

<p>During typical operation, the pressure between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of reduced pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is created to open and discharge water to the outside if either check valve need to leak.
