<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a considerable obstruction that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
