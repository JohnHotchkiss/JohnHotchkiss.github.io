<p>Wood pipes were used in London and elsewhere during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were extensively used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and conduits, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
<p>A plumbing permit provides for 3 inspections. Extra inspections are $50.00 each.

In some cases it may be needed to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. Commercial cleaners are offered if the resin becomes fouled. Cleaners need to be utilized according to maker guidelines to prevent contamination.</p>
