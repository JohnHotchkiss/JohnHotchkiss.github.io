<p>Climatic vacuum breakers (AVB) are the most basic style of backflow preventer. If you have less than six control valves, they are the least expensive, however also the least reliable option. These devices are not developed as a whole-system backflow prevention valve; one should be set up at every control valve. Sprinkler Warehouse does not suggest AVB's for waterings systems where there is a possible to pollute drinking water. AVB's are not testable and it is not possible to detect when one has actually stopped working.</p>

Often the type and installation requirements are spelled out by local statutes and environmental guidelines. Local building codes for instance will require a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air space between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any possible siphon before it can occur, avoiding contaminating water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more sophisticated and complicated backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices set up to prevent backflow variety from the fairly simple to the complicated and very sophisticated.</p>
