<p>When lime is added to the water, it alters the water chemistry, causing the calcium to come out of the solution. The particles of calcium integrate, become much heavier than the remainder of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next step of the treatment procedure. Flexible gas lines are typically more suitable to inflexible lines, especially in locations where earthquakes are more typical and for the connection in between the supply and device. Flexible gas lines are less most likely to be detached in a natural catastrophe which decreases the threat of a surge or fire.</p>
