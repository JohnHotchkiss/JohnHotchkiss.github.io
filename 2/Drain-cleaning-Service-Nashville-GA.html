Customer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get a price quote from personal plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of business we called would offer a quote over the phone. All of them wished to take a look at the situation prior to committing to a price, and all wanted to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks discovered just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
