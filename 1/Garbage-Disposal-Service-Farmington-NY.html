<p>The majority of homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather security. As the external coating of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>A double check backflow preventer features 2 spring-loaded check assemblies to prevent back siphonage and back pressure on non-health danger (low risk) systems. Loosen the coupling nut that connects the supply line. Hold its base with a locking pliers if the toilet valve turns inside the toilet tank. Idea: Throw a towel on the floor below to catch water that will drain from the line.</p>
