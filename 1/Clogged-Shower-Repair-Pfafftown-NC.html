<p>The easiest method to keep you and your household safe from the potential dangers of backflow through cross connections is to not produce cross connections in the first location. Nevertheless, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, swimming pool, water feature or other kind of cross connection, have an authorized backflow prevention assembly installed.</p>
<p>If your hot water heater has actually required numerous repairs over the last couple of years, it may be time to get it replaced. An excellent guideline for hot water heater is this: due to the fact that the life expectancy of the typical water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
