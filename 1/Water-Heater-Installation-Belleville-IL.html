<p>To figure out which toilet valve is causing the problem, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overflowing into the tube, there's a problem with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, consistent outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing completely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water discolorations and corrosion. But don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
