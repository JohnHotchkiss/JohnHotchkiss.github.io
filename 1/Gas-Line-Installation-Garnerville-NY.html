Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with.

When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated correctly.
