To just put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is typical in our market and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace.

It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately working together that you can attain this.</p>
