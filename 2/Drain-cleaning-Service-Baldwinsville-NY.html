<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might have to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug kit that I bought separately from the disposal system. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>So, if you wish to stop having to wiggle your toilet manage whenever you flush and are sick and tired of publishing respectful signs in your bathroom everytime you have people over, get a brand-new journey lever that actually works for your toilet. While certain specialized flush valves or flappers may require a particular journey lever to work effectively, most toilets will work just fine with a "will fit" lever - which is great news for people who can't find their model number or who maybe have remodeled or upgraded their components and want a various finish or design handle to match the rest of their bathroom décor.</p>
