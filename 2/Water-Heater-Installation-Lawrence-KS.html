<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Lawrence KS</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
