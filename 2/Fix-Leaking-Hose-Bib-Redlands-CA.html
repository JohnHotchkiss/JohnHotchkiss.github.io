<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material.

More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.
