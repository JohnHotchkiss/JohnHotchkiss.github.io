<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Norwalk CA!</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
