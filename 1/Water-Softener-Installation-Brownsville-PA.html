A waste disposal unit generally plugs into a 120-volt GFCI (ground-fault circuit interruptor) outlet under the sink. If an outlet like this isn't available under your sink, you'll need to have an electrician install one.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers bring only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
