<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can purchase models with unique features that do everything however include the salt, you will pay for each additional feature. The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm warranty that the special feature will not fail. Depending upon the water source, you may need to filter turbid water or decontaminate bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening system. Finally, if you own a septic tank, you need to consider the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regeneration. Estimates indicate that about 50 gallons of water are utilized for each regrowth cycle. This might or might not trigger hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the best is typical in our market and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly working together that you can attain this.</p>
