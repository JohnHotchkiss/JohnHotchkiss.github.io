<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains substantial amounts of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a nuisance-- for its many intended uses around your home.</p>
<p>Every day, the drains in your home effectively remove large quantities of water and waste. In time, dirt, particles, hair, and many other small particles can get trapped and build up in your pipes. Eventually, the water might not have the ability to drain rapidly or effectively, and you might experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is continuously supporting. When this happens, it may be time to contact a professional from Atlas Plumbing to examine.</p>

<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and avoid it from working. This is referred to as fouling.

Cleaners need to be used according to maker guidelines to avoid contamination.</p>
