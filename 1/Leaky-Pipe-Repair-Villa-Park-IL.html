<p>We had roots through our sewer line so it was often clogging. They came out and dug a new path for the line linked it to the sewer and whatever.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is normal in our market and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
