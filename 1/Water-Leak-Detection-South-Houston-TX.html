<p>Deterioration is a complex phenomenon and there are many elements that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For many years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that speed up rust Likewise, there is an absence of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable kind of corrosion control. Therefore, thinking about all these factors, in addition to arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>

Piping must be at least 18 inches listed below ground for much safer areas and 24 inches for places at higher threat of external damage.</p>
