<p>Understand that softened water consists of trace quantities of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water consists of about the same amount of salt as a slice of bread. That's not quite salt, but for those on a stringent sodium-free diet plan it might be excessive. If this doesn't work, you may need to replace one of your toilet's elements, normally the flapper.

Nevertheless, if the pipe is constantly leaking and needs regular repairs, we would suggest repiping. At Super Plumbers, we never recommend products or services that would not genuinely benefit the consumer.</p>
