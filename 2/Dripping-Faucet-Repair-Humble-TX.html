When figuring out the hardness of water, there are series of grains per gallon (gpg). Rinckey said that both Belding and Greenville city water steps around 18 gpg, which is considered very hard water, leaving telltale signs like spotty glasses and soap scum that is beside impossible to remove. With well water, these signs may likewise be coupled with iron spots and sulfur-smells originating from the tap.</p>

Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.

Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for lots of decades, but steel ultimately struggles with deterioration and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
