<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes in Chittenango NY</h3>
<p>Deterioration is a complex phenomenon and there are many aspects that speed up rust in the drinking-water distribution system and premise plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that speed up rust Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of corrosion control. Thus, thinking about all these elements, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
