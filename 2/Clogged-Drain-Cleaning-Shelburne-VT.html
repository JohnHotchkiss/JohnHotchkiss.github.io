Friendly, educated service technician. He got our drain cleared out in a very efficient and professional  way. I would not think twice to call Roto-Rooter for any future requirements.

The device allows water to press the check valves open when water is entering the building, but closes them shut when water tries to go the incorrect method. There are two different kinds of testable backflow prevention devices that are typically specified-- a decreased pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a few others that I will mention but do not get hung up on them. I mention them just due to the fact that they will be on a certification test.</p>
