<h3>How to Remove a Sink Drain Pop Up in Clinton MD</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>

<p>To prep your system for installation, you may have to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug kit that I bought separately from the disposal system. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>During water, installation and electricity are shut down to the area. The old plumbing and sink flange are eliminated and cleaned of any putty. Loosen the nuts that connect the drain pipe, consisting of the curved trap, at the sink drain and near the wall or floor. Utilize your hands for PVC connections or a monkey wrench for metal connections. Place a bucket underneath the drain pipe to catch any water that leaks out.</p>
