<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can cause leakages. As these leaks take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been found to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these problems.</p>
