<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
