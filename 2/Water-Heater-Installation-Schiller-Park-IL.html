<p>Spotty meals? Distribution pipes transition to even smaller individual service pipes, carrying water to specific houses, home stores, businesses and buildings. Depending upon need, these pipes vary in size from a half inch in diameter to 6 inches.

Specific service pipelines are usually made from plastic, type or lead K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be important.</p>
