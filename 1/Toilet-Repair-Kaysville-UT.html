<p>A brand-new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of worn thin pipe and the painting the within the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Often during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin areas leak right away and in some cases those leaks come days or weeks later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be correctly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
