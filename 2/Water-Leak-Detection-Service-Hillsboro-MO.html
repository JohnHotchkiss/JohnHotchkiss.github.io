<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
