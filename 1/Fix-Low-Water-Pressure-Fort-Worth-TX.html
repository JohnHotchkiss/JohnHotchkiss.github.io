<p>Backflow preventers are critical for producing a safe water supply system. No matter which model you choose, all water softeners need to be properly preserved. The brine option must be mixed and kept in the salt water tank. Regular clogging of the resin likewise requires special attention. For example, if the raw supply of water is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, normal backwashing with water will fix this problem. If not, slowly stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help break up the material. Also, fungi and bacteria also form mats in the resin that decrease its efficiency. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these nuisances. However, read the maker's directions before including any chemicals to the system.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with.
