Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, however if you've been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this boost can position problems.</p>
