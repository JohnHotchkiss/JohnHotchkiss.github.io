<p>Obvious smell. The moment you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the backyard, basement, or throughout your home or service location, provide us a call. That odor might be coming from your sewer system, which needs repair work immediately. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that gets rid of sewage from your house, launches sewer gas, and manages air pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually stopped working, it will often need to be replaced rather than repaired. If your pipes are gurgling or producing nasty odors, you'll understand this.</p>
