<h3>Drain Pipe Repair in Columbus Georgia</h2>
<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
