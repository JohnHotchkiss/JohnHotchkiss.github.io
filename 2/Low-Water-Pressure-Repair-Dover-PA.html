<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

<p>For about $12, you can route your dishwasher to the waste disposal unit with a dishwasher drain connector, which assists rid the pipes of particles and waste that your dishwasher would otherwise push through your system.

<p>At least as soon as every 3 months, drain water from the tank. Gradually sediment constructs at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct performance, and draining pipes a gallon or so helps get rid of the sediment. If you spot a leak and select a patching task instead of a repiping task, simply remember that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the exact same material and they might be next. To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to think about repiping your entire house when you identify a leak.</p>
