<p>The cost associated with sewer line inspection might differ significantly based upon your circumstances. Property owners can normally expect a cost point between $100 and $300, however obviously, this is simply a rough estimate.

<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial clog, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
