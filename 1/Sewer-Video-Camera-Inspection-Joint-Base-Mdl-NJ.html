<p>Routine professional maintenance is essential to avoiding water heater problems. Your water heater must be examined by a professional a minimum of once a year. During routine maintenance, we will examine the pressure relief valve and other crucial components, in addition to inspect the tank for rust and rust. We will likewise drain the tank to remove any sediment that has developed within.</p>
<p>Tough water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so just softened water goes through to your house. Once the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it should be restored (cleaned up). Salt is typically utilized in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Generally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
