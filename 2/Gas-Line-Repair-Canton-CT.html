If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close.
