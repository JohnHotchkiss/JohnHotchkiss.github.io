<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>

<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Armonk NY</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
