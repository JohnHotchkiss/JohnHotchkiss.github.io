Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To find a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Switch off the water before removing the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, however opportunities are you'll locate among the exact same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of small, possibly less vital things that can break or deteriorate. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
