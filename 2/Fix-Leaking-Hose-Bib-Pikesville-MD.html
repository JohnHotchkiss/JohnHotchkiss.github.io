<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and elsewhere during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and avenues, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
<p>Gas lines featured outer covers that are mainly made from plastic. Eliminate them to expose the gas pipes underneath.
