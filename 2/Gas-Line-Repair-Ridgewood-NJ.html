<p>Supplying quality and professional repair, replacement, and installation services for your plumbing. Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers.

This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water coming from your water appliances? This is a good indication that your pipes may be rusting from the within and for that reason, need to be replaced. Keep in mind that if the rust-colored water only includes warm water, the cause could be a rusted out water heater-- not your home's piping.</p>
