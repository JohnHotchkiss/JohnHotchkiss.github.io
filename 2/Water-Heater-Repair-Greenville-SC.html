<p>IRWD is committed to providing safe, high quality water to customers. Our comprehensive water quality program runs 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water provided to our consumers is kept free from hazardous contaminants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to devices consisting of a nonpotable substance, this is known as a cross-connection. Contamination may occur when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating and cooling system, into the drinkable water system. This can take place through a procedure known as backflow.</p>
<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and in other places throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly utilized in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and avenues, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>

In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they need to be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a substantial warning that something more major is wrong with them.</p>
