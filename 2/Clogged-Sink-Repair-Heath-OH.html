In some cases, nevertheless, the damage is so comprehensive that you either need to replace the whole toilet, or the cost of repairs is so big that replacement is just a more useful option. This generally involves cracks in the toilet bowl itself, extensive deterioration over numerous components, or merely because you  want to replace your existing toilet with something more visually pleasing.</p>

Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water stains and deterioration.
