<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps capture moisture and sediment so that they do not get in the control system. Unlike a drip leg, the flow of the gas is become get rid of any sediment. A sediment trap may be included in a drip leg install. The City requires backflow prevention gadgets to be set up anywhere there exists a connection that might permit tainted water into the City system or private plumbing.

<p>For a cutoff switch where the backflow preventer lies downstream of the booster pump( s) - set at 20 psi. Waste disposal unit also require regular usage to prevent malfunction.

<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent dual flush HET used by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.
