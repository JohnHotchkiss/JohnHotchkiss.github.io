<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>

Backflow into a public water supply can contaminate or infect the water in that system (i.e., backflow into a public water supply can make the water because system risky or unusable to consume), and each water supplier has an obligation to provide water that is functional and safe to consume under all foreseeable circumstances. Moreover, customers usually have outright faith that water delivered to them through a public water supply is always safe to drink.

<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has actually frequently been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to overstated marketing and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment.

The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not need. However, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
