<p>As explained earlier in the article, carbon monoxide is entirely odor-free and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide gas detector. Every house must have carbon monoxide detectors set up at the appropriate locations. In California, it is a requirement for all multi-family and single houses to have both smoke and carbon monoxide gas detectors. They are normally sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new installations should have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
<p>To prevent these things from obstructing your drains and causing damage, Larry & Sons suggests that you use hair and food stoppers throughout your house. These cool additions to your sinks and tubs can reduce the quantity of hair and food scraps that end up in your drains.
