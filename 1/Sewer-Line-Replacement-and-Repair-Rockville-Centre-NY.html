<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
