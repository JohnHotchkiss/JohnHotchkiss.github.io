<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are lots of factors that speed up rust in the drinking-water distribution system and premise plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it crucial to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that speed up rust Also, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective kind of rust control. Therefore, thinking about all these factors, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that a correctly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
