<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- generally sodium. The outcome is water that's been efficiently softened by removing almost all traces of the minerals that make up tough water.</p>
<h3>Leak Repair in Kinston North Carolina</h2>
<p>In some cases, our service technicians will advise that you replace your water heater rather than purchase repairs. This is typically the case when the hot water heater is more than 10 years old or the cost of repairs would amount to more than half the cost of a whole new unit. Sometimes a troublesome toilet just needs a minor change and life is back to typical. That is why we provide a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) adjust the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) carry out a color test.</p>
<p>With the seriousness of plumbing problems being equal, you may be better off changing your toilet if it is an older model. Older toilets frequently follow more lax policies in regards to water usage, so a newer toilet may wind up saving you money each month. Nevertheless, some plumbing systems work best with older toilets. Seek advice from a specialist at Metcalf Plumbing to see if you need toilet repair or replacement, particularly if you have actually cast iron plumbing.</p>
<p>There are lots of components to a toilet that interact to make it operate. If it is not flushing properly, there might be a concern with the deal with or the lift arm. It could also be the flush lever or the flapper. A skilled technician would be able to identify which part is failing to make the toilet repair immediately. Is your hot water heater giving cold rather of warm water? Yikes! It might be something as easy as a blown pilot light or as made complex as a faulty thermocouple. Relighting the pilot light might be a Do It Yourself job. Repairing or replacing the thermocouple is a task for our team of skilled pros.</p>
