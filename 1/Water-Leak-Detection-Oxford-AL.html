<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Oxford AL</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily trigger countless dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel way off schedule. So working with a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers manage all kinds of work. Their duties break out into 2 classifications: Plumbers who manage fundamental repairs (frequently in emergency situations), and plumbers who focus on redesigning additions and projects.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as hard water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
