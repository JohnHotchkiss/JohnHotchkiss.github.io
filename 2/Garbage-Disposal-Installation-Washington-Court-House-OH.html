<p>Action 6: To connect the drain, place the gasket in the discharge outlet. Then attach the discharge tube with the flange and bolts.

Make sure the discharge pipe is lined up properly and link your drains-- use a T-pipe before your P-trap.</p>

If your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth, you ought to wait up until after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings. You need to also examine to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
