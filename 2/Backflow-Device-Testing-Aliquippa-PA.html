<p>To determine which toilet valve is triggering the difficulty, take a look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to trickle into the bowl. That slow, continuous outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing totally. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water discolorations and corrosion. But do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>

The disposal will normally be connected to the drain line with either a nut or a screw.</p>
