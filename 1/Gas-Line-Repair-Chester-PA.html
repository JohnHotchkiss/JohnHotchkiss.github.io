Often it takes place in the evening when you don't discover the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or link a new pipe. This makes building and construction projects quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow.

<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and somewhere else throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively utilized in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
