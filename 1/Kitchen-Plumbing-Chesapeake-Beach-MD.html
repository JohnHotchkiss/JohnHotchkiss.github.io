<p>Both irrigation water and clean water systems are at high risk of coming into contact with contaminants due to backflows. Lots of faucets can have a low-flow aerator set up at the outlet end of the water spout.

Adding air in this method keeps constant water pressure, which causes the fixture to use less water.</p>
<p>If you switch on your house's water spigots and water starts flowing out with a yellowish, brownish or reddish tint, that's a clear sign that rust or sediment has developed in your pipes and a repiping job ought to be in your future.

<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler typically are set up in locations where water could cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
