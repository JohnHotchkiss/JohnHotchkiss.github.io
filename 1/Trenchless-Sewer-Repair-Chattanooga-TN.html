<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial blockage, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further investigation, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
