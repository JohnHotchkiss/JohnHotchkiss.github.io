Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
