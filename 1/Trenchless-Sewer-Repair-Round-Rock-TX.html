<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Round Rock TX</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
