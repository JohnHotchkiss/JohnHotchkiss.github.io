<p>Regular leakages: Leaks originating from your water heater are never ever a great indication. If your hot water heater has regular leaks or is continuously needing repairs, it is likely more cost-effective to replace the whole unit.

Its sole task is to avoid drinking water from being polluted due to backflow.</p>

If the P-trap under you sink is clogged, it can cause water to develop all the way up your drains and produce a leak someplace along the method.
