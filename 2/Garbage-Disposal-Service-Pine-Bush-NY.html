Although an EcoWater dealership does not support your area currently, we are happy to assist you with an alternative service. You can buy, with free shipping, a leading name-brand filtration or softener system by shopping at Any installation services listed below can then help with installation, or you can just install the system yourself.</p>

<p>Softeners primarily remove calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently referred to as 'solidity minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they must be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a huge red flag that something more major is wrong with them.</p>
<p>Call a plumber: If the clog is not in the P-trap and water streams easily from the sink drain into your pail, then it's time to call a plumber The clog is most likely further down the line. Leaking sewer lines inside your home can harm floors, carpentry, and other valuable objects such as cabinets. Left ignored, leaking sewer water can cause mold and far more severe structural damage.
