<p>There are 2 fundamental kinds of toilet flushing systems; both types save water by utilizing 1.6 gallons of water per flush. Gravity-fed flush toilets utilize the force of gravity and a siphon "pull-through" action to empty the bowl. Try to find gravity-fed toilets offering high efficiency to effectively and quietly get rid of waste. CIPP: Apollo utilizes this technology to repair a damaged pipe.

<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of significant surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it just implies old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing frequent and major leakages, you could be in need of water line repiping. If you do have regular leaks, we find that repiping can actually be the less expensive and much better long-lasting solution.</p>

Depending on your requirements, you may need more than one tankless water heater to meet your daily hot water demands.</p>

We will generally suggest our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending upon the severity of the situation. Give us a call if your kitchen drain has actually raised water levels, is making gurgling sounds, smells nasty, or is slow to drain.</p>
