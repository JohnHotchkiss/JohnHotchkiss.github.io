<p>A backflow preventer is a way or mechanism to avoid backflow. The standard methods of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The basic mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the reason for the problem. The line was plainly degrading; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
