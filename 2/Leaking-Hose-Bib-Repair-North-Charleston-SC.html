<h3>The Different Kinds Of Plumbers North Charleston SC</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
