<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is typical in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
