Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To discover a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, but chances are you'll locate one of the same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
