<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is typically used in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continually bringing tanks off-line and online in action to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, just one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than conventional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
