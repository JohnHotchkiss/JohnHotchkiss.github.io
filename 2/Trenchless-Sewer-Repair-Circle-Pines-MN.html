Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
