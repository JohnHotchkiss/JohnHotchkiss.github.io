"Restoring" describes the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "tired" or full. Nevertheless, many water softeners regrow frequently, when the filter medium really isn't complete. This can be corrected by merely resetting your water softener to eliminate less firmness or to run longer between regrowth cycles.</p>
