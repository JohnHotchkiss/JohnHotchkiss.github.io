<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the defective pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

It also traps particles and prevents the formation of blockages. Leakages in this unit, are probably a result of a loose connection, corrosion, and, obstructions.</p>
