<p>You need to invest a minimum of $50 to get a top quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a resilient finish and a reliable stopper system.

The twist-and-drop style is much easier to utilize but needs occasional -ring replacement.</p>

Remove it and take it to the shop to discover a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers usually replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
