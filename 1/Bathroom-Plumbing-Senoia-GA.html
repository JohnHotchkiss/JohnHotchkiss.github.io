Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To find a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Switch off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, but opportunities are you'll find one of the exact same shape and size.
