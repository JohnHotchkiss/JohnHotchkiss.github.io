<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed effective, Sam Blanc created and developed a smaller model that operated on the exact same principle but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise built a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and community sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable. It was terminated in 1973.</p>

It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
