<p>When the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage turned off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
