<p>Waste disposal unit are an essential feature in any modern-day kitchen. If you live in an older home, your sink may not have one, forcing you to be thorough about keeping food scraps from flowing down the drain. It's also possible for a disposal to suddenly break, bringing cooking or clean-up to a grinding halt. Copper pipes = $1.50-$ 2.00 per linear foot.

<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
