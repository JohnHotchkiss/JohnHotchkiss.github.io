<p>It is highly suggested not to attempt any Do It Yourself when is connected to Garbage Disposals installation.

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close.
