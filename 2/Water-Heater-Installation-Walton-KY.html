<p>The Last Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that manages water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters your toilet.

If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't installed appropriately, you may experience an often or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in lost water.</p>
