<p>Repiping is not a short-term fix. It's a permanent solution for the entire plumbing system in your home or business. We turn off the supply of water, remove old pipe and replace it with new pipe. After the new system is set up, we turn the water on and carry out tests on the brand-new system. Once the system passes our tests, it's good to opt for you.</p>
