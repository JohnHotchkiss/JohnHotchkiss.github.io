<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal flow direction within a piping system that is triggered by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of normal circulation in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain won't fix the problem. You might need to check out utilizing a high pressure water system to get rid of the clog.

<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Wayne PA</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be needed to be found on the water service line, within the structure, or both places.
