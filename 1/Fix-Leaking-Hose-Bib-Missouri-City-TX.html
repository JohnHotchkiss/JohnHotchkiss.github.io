Chances are that your house might need substantial repiping so that your home's plumbing can work at optimal rates if your home was built decades prior to that.</p>

<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and in other places during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly utilized in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
