<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Freeport TX</h3>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line clogs are not something a homeowner can fix. This type of clog requires a professional plumber or drain professional to use a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can make use of a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to identify and repair the drain problem. This type of camera is specifically useful in finding an issue if you have a long sewer line from your house to the sewer system or septic tank.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, allowing air to enter the valve and restore pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
