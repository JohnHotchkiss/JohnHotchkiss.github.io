It's prevalent for a toilet to have broken parts at some point which triggers the toilet to run. What they mean is the toilet will not stop running when someone says a toilet is running. This is generally due to worn out flapper valve, but a few other common problems are the fill valve and the overflow tube.</p>
<p>When pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the safe and clean system offering the makeup water, backpressure is produced. This can force the drinkable water to reverse its instructions of flow through the cross-connection between the two systems. Possible pollutants can then go into the drinkable water supply. The very best method to reduce accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of as soon as a year.

Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to eliminate.</p>
