<p>Won't drain - The system might not be slicing food appropriately and waste may have clogged the drain pipe. However, if there are several leakages within the system, or if there is proof of corrosion in numerous places, it is probably time to repipe. A water softener is loaded with resin beads. Tough water with calcium and magnesium streams through this resin and, in a procedure called ion exchange, the solidity ions in the water trade places with soft ions on the resin beads. The result is soft water.</p>
