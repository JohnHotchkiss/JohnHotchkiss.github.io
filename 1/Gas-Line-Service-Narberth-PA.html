<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
