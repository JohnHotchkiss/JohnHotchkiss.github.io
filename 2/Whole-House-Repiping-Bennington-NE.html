<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Bennington NE</h3>
<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts should be removed and replaced with new rubber parts. It is necessary that only original factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was designed to use and altering the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- generally 2 layers of protection. The device permits water to press the check valves open when water is entering into the building, however closes them shut when water tries to go the wrong way.
