<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed effective, Sam Blanc created and constructed a smaller sized design that operated on the very same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise built a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
