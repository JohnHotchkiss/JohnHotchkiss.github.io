There are few instances when plumbing inspections are compulsory, but the largest exceptions are construction and home updates.

<h3>Dishwasher Hook Up in Abington Massachusetts</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did a minimum of 3 efforts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his knowledge and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the recently cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and patience the job was done to my total satisfaction.</p>
