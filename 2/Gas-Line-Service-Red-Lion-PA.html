<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
