That smell might be coming from your sewer system, which needs repair work immediately. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that gets rid of sewage from your house, launches sewer gas, and regulates air pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually stopped working, it will typically need to be replaced rather than fixed. If your pipes are gurgling or giving off foul smells, you'll understand this.</p>
<p>While numerous hot water heater problems can be effectively fixed, some issues will demand complete hot water heater replacement. If your water heater is past its regular life-span (generally anywhere from 8 to 10 years or longer if you have a tankless water heater) or if it has a major leak or comprehensive rust, it may be time to consider replacement.</p>
