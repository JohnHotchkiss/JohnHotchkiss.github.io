For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that speed up deterioration Likewise, there is an absence of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable kind of rust control. Hence, considering all these factors, as well as results from research study studies, WQA's position is that a correctly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
