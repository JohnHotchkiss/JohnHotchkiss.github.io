When your water lines are repiped, it simply means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing regular and major leakages, you could be in need of water line repiping.

That means 8 less inches of hot water, not to point out the reality that your faucet water is being warmed in a tank with calcium, scale, rust, dirt, iron, and sulfuric‐smelling germs.</p>
