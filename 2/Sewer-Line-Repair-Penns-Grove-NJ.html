A drain expert like TLC will use a camera to examine your drain system.

The camera can identify the problem and locate so the drain can be repaired.</p>
<p>A plumbing license offers three inspections. Extra inspections are $50.00 each. Inspections employed on work not completed, not appropriately set up, or on an unattainable property will require re-inspection.

<p>Your disposer may come with a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, instead of the standard plumber's putty as outlined below. Both will develop a great seal (though the gasket may lead to percentages of water gathering around the flange), and what's utilized is mostly a matter of choice. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's harder to eliminate.</p>
