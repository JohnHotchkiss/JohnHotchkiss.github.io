<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will ultimately take its toll.

Nevertheless, in an appropriately working toilet, the water must stop running as soon as the bowl is filled to its proper capacity.

<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
