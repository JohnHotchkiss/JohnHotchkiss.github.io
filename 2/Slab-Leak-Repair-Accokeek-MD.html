<p>Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) needs plumbing contractors to acquire a plumbing license before installing or changing a backflow preventer. Provided there isn't a tank failure, typically a commercial water heater can be fixed, however is it worth fixing? Only after responding to the following questions should you respond to repair or replace. Do you know how many years of ages your water heater is?

In some models, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>
