<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Okemos MI</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause thousands of dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel way off schedule. So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers deal with all kinds of work. Their tasks break out into 2 classifications: Plumbers who manage fundamental repairs (typically in emergency scenarios), and plumbers who specialize in remodeling tasks and additions.</p>
<p>Examine the status of your water heater's anode rod if you see rust just in your hot water. If you've never ever done this on your own, you may need a professional to do this. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is more than likely coming from the inside of your hot water heater. Replace your water heater as quickly as possible if this is the case. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your cold and hot water taps, you most likely have worn away piping.</p>
