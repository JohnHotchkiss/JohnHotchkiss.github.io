<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board encourages the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections regarding the administration of Post 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, including licensing. Backsiphonage occurs when there is an unfavorable pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a private water system into the general public water system. This can happen at any time, such as during a water pipe break or during a large firefighting effort.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is typical in our industry and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
