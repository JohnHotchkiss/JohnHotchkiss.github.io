<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make certain to take the appropriate precautions if utilizing among these products.</p>
