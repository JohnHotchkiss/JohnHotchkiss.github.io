<p>Inside the house, examine the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for drips or leaks. Check below sinks to check for leaking pipes. Local plumber priced quote cost of $400 to install plus cost of garbage disposal. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ pleased I checked around. Under the sink, put a container or pan underneath the waste pipe, then utilize locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to disconnect the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's waste pipe.
