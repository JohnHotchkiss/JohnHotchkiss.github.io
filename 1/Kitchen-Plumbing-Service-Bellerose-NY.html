Using his knowledge and experience he figured out that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink.

<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Regrettably, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these issues.</p>
