<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts must be eliminated and changed with new rubber parts. It is necessary that only original factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was designed to utilize and changing the rubber from the initial factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>

The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if necessary, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
