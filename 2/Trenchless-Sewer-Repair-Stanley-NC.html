<h3>Gas Line Inspection in Stanley North Carolina</h2>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
