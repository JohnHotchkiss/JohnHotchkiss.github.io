<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Easton PA</h3>
<p>SofTap's water softening technology is well-suited for household, commercial, and commercial applications, consisting of the prevention of limescale accumulation in households and scaling in industrial water treatment systems, as well as enhancing existing reverse osmosis treatment systems. The technology is simpler and more affordable than other softening systems on the market today that use zeolites, which need to be regrowed utilizing salt water, or membrane nanofiltration that needs significant water use and high pressure.</p>
<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
