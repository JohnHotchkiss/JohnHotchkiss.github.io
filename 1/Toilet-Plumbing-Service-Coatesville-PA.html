<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
