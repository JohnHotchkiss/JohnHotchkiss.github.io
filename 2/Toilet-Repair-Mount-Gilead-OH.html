I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial blockage, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to investigate.
