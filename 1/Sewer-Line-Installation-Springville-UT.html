Fire defense system are created to match the hazard that exists in the locations they are set up in. As building types and contents of these structures can be extremely various, we need to understand that the fire defense system for any installation requires to be designed and installed to satisfy that particular risk or need. An airplane hangar will need a very different fire defense system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow protection requirements for these 2 examples would also vary greatly.</p>
