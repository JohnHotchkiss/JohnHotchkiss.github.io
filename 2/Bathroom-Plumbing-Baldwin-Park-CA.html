<p>Backflow preventers are important for producing a safe water system system. No matter which model you select, all water softeners need to be effectively preserved. The salt water option must be mixed and saved in the salt water tank. Routine obstructing of the resin also needs unique attention. For example, if the raw water supply is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, normal backwashing with water will solve this problem. If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help separate the product. Likewise, fungi and germs also form mats in the resin that minimize its effectiveness. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these nuisances. However, read the maker's instructions before including any chemicals to the unit.</p>

Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
