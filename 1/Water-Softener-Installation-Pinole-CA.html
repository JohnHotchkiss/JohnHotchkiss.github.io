<p>Understand that softened water contains trace quantities of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water contains about the same amount of salt as a slice of bread. That's not quite salt, but for those on a stringent sodium-free diet plan it may be too much. If this does not work, you might need to replace one of your toilet's components, typically the flapper. There may also be a problem with the chain attached to the float or the flapper ball. A plumber can easily replace these parts.</p>

<p>In many cases, the toilet can be repaired instead of changed, since the problem typically boils down to a single component or 2.
