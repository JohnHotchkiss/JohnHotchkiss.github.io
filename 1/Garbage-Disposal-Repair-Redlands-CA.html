I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
