<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back against the required instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. There is capacity for the polluted water to end up being a health risk if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for efficiency, as well as inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
