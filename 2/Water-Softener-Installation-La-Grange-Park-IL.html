<p>Most houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition protection. As the external coating of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
