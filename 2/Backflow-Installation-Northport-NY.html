<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
