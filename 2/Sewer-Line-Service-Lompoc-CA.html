<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Lompoc CA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
