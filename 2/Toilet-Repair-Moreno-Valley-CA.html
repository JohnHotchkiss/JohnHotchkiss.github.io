<p>Woodbury, in addition to lots of other communities and organizations, has discovered the very best method to avoid these spots from occurring is by reducing the variety of times your water softener regenerates. "Restoring" describes the method softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "exhausted" or full. However, lots of water softeners regenerate too often, when the filter medium truly isn't complete. This can be remedied by simply resetting your water softener to eliminate less firmness or to run longer in between regeneration cycles.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
