<p>A plumbing permit offers three inspections. Additional inspections are $50.00 each.

It is the authorization holder's duty to reschedule the inspection and make arrangements for the plumbing inspector to access the home.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede versus the needed direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health risk if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for effectiveness, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
