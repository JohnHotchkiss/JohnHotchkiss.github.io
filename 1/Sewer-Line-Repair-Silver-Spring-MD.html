These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be greater.</p>
<p>However, if the clog is further down the sewer line, requiring unique equipment to be generated, it will cost more, particularly if flooring needs to be brought up or the toilet has to be restored. If you have a manual snake, you can try to separate the clog yourself initially before calling a professional.

<h3>Leak Detection Services: Leave It to the Silver Spring MD Experts</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
