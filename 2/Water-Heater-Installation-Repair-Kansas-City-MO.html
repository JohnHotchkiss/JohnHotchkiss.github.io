Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To find a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Turn off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, however opportunities are you'll locate one of the exact same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
<p>Toilet repair can look stealthily basic when you see a diagram of the working parts. You believe, Sure, I can do that," but checked out the directions thoroughly.

Even if you make it this far, the only thing you can do if your new tank flush valve does not work is look for leaks" and make modifications." All of a sudden, a fifty-minute job becomes an indefinitely unsolved problem.</p>
