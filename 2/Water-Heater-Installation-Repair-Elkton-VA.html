<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. A response team is readily available for initial examination of sewer emergency situations every day of the year. If sewage from the City-maintained portion of the sewer system backs up through sinks or toilets, call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance personnel at (503) 823-1700. City employees will inspect and remove obstructions in the mainline sewer and the part of the service line that the City is accountable for. You might have to wait up until the storm has decreased to have the backup solved if the problem is the outcome of too much storm water in the system.</p>
<p>Because of the inherent design of a minimized pressure backflow assembly, changing supply pressure on an extremely low flow or fixed circulation condition may cause nuisance dripping and prospective fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of changing supply pressure.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can acquire designs with unique functions that do whatever but include the salt, you will spend for each additional function. The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm warranty that the unique function will not fail. Depending on the water source, you might have to filter turbid water or disinfect bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening system. Lastly, if you own a septic system, you ought to consider the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates show that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regeneration cycle. This might or might not cause hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
<p>A check backflow preventer features two spring-loaded check assemblies to avoid back and back siphonage pressure on non-health risk (low risk) systems. Loosen the coupling nut that connects the supply line. If the toilet valve turns inside the toilet tank, hold its base with a locking pliers. Tip: Throw a towel on the floor underneath to capture water that will drain from the line.</p>
