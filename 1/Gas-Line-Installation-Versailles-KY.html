<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
