<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the cause of the problem. The line was clearly deteriorating; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
