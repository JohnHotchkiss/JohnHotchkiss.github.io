<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing frequent and significant leaks. We discover that repiping can really be the more affordable and much better long-term solution if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
<p>Sometimes you understand you have a sewer line break since you can smell foul smells or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is important to determine the specific area of the break in your sewer line. Oftentimes the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can save you countless dollars in repairs. Just sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can fix the problem. The specialists and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you always have a copy for your insurance real estate agent, company or city inspector.</p>
