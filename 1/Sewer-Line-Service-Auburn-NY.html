<h3>How To Stop Emergency Plumbing Water Damages Auburn NY</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
