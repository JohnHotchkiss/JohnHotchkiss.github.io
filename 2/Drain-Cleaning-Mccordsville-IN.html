<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>Tough water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water goes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is typically utilized in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>
