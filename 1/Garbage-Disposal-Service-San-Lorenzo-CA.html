<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
